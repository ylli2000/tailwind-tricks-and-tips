This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Demo Features

## 1. Dark Mode Toggle
No theme flicker! The app uses cookies to store the user's theme and color-temperature. If cookies exist, the theme is pre-rendered server-side for a seamless experience. If no cookies are set, the system preference is detected in the useTheme hookâ€”this may delay the button render for a moment, but there is never a theme flicker.

### Theme Handling (Dark/Light & Hot/Cold)

- The app now uses **cookies** (not localStorage) to store the user's `theme` (dark/light) and `color-temperature` (hot/cold).
- On the server, these cookies are read and the values are injected as classes on the `<html>` tag, allowing for correct initial theme and color rendering with no hydration mismatch or FOUC.
- The client-side `fouc.tsx` script is no longer needed and has been deleted.
- The `ThemeToggle` and `useTheme` hook now receive the initial theme and color values from cookies, ensuring the UI is correct on first render.
- This approach follows Tailwind's recommendation to set theme classes on `<html>` and provides a seamless SSR experience.

### How it works

1. **User toggles theme or color temperature:**
   - The new value is saved to a cookie using `js-cookie`.
2. **On each request:**
   - The server reads the cookies and sets the appropriate classes on `<html>`.
   - The initial theme and color are passed to React components for correct initial state.
3. **No FOUC or hydration errors:**
   - The initial render always matches between server and client.

## 2. Group Hover Example
Shows how to use Tailwind's `group-hover` utility to style child elements when a parent is hovered. Hover over the blue box to see the inner squares change color.

## 3. Peer Hover Example
Demonstrates the `peer-hover` utility, where hovering one element (the peer) changes the style of another. Hover over the green box to see the effect on the adjacent element.

## 4. Group Hover with Image
Illustrates a practical use of `group-hover` by swapping an image on hover. Hover over the image to see it change.

## 5. Animation Utilities
Examples of Tailwind's built-in animation classes: `animate-ping`, `animate-spin`, `animate-bounce`, and `animate-pulse`. Each animation is shown with a different emoji or text for visual effect.

### 6. Extending Tailwind CSS
Demonstrates how to extend Tailwind with custom utilities and theme extensions:
- `neon-shadow`: A custom shadow class defined in `globals.css`.
- `shadow-neon`: A custom box shadow added via Tailwind's theme extension in `tailwind.config.mjs`.
- `neon-*`: A set of custom classes generated by a Tailwind plugin for various neon-colored shadows.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

## Development
- To run the app: `npm run dev`
- To build: `npm run build`
