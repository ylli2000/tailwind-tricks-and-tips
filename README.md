This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Demo Features

### 1. Dark Mode Toggle
A demonstration of how to implement dark mode in a Next.js app using Tailwind CSS. Click the ‚òÄÔ∏è or üåô icon in the top-right corner to toggle between light and dark themes. The theme logic is managed by a `ThemeWrapper` and configured in `globals.css`.

### 2. Group Hover Example
Shows how to use Tailwind's `group-hover` utility to style child elements when a parent is hovered. Hover over the blue box to see the inner squares change color.

### 3. Peer Hover Example
Demonstrates the `peer-hover` utility, where hovering one element (the peer) changes the style of another. Hover over the green box to see the effect on the adjacent element.

### 4. Group Hover with Image
Illustrates a practical use of `group-hover` by swapping an image on hover. Hover over the image to see it change.

### 5. Animation Utilities
Examples of Tailwind's built-in animation classes: `animate-ping`, `animate-spin`, `animate-bounce`, and `animate-pulse`. Each animation is shown with a different emoji or text for visual effect.

### 6. Extending Tailwind CSS
Demonstrates how to extend Tailwind with custom utilities and theme extensions:
- `neon-shadow`: A custom shadow class defined in `globals.css`.
- `shadow-neon`: A custom box shadow added via Tailwind's theme extension in `tailwind.config.mjs`.
- `neon-*`: A set of custom classes generated by a Tailwind plugin for various neon-colored shadows.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
