This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Demo Features

## 1. Dark Mode Toggle
No theme flicker! The app uses cookies to store the user's theme and color-temperature. If cookies exist, the theme is pre-rendered server-side for a seamless experience. If no cookies are set, the system preference is detected in the useTheme hookâ€”this may delay the button render for a moment, but there is never a theme flicker.

### Theme Handling (Dark/Light & Hot/Cold)

- The app now uses **cookies** (not localStorage) to store the user's `theme` (dark/light) and `color-temperature` (hot/cold).
- On the server, these cookies are read and the values are injected as classes on the `<html>` tag, allowing for correct initial theme and color rendering with no hydration mismatch or FOUC.
- The client-side `fouc.tsx` script is no longer needed and has been deleted.
- The `ThemeToggle` and `useTheme` hook now receive the initial theme and color values from cookies, ensuring the UI is correct on first render.
- This approach follows Tailwind's recommendation to set theme classes on `<html>` and provides a seamless SSR experience.

### How it works

1. **User toggles theme or color temperature:**
   - The new value is saved to a cookie using `js-cookie`.
2. **On each request:**
   - The server reads the cookies and sets the appropriate classes on `<html>`.
   - The initial theme and color are passed to React components for correct initial state.
3. **No FOUC or hydration errors:**
   - The initial render always matches between server and client.

## 2. Group Hover Example
Shows how to use Tailwind's `group-hover` utility to style child elements when a parent is hovered. Hover over the blue box to see the inner squares change color.

## 3. Peer Hover Example
Demonstrates the `peer-hover` utility, where hovering one element (the peer) changes the style of another. Hover over the green box to see the effect on the adjacent element.

## 4. Group Hover with Image
Illustrates a practical use of `group-hover` by swapping an image on hover. Hover over the image to see it change.

## 5. Animation Utilities
Examples of Tailwind's built-in animation classes: `animate-ping`, `animate-spin`, `animate-bounce`, and `animate-pulse`. Each animation is shown with a different emoji or text for visual effect.

### 6. Extending Tailwind CSS
Demonstrates how to extend Tailwind with custom utilities and theme extensions:
- `neon-shadow`: A custom shadow class defined in `globals.css`.
- `shadow-neon`: A custom box shadow added via Tailwind's theme extension in `tailwind.config.mjs`.
- `neon-*`: A set of custom classes generated by a Tailwind plugin for various neon-colored shadows.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

*This project demonstrates advanced theme handling with Tailwind CSS and Next.js, using cookies for SSR-friendly, flicker-free theming.*

## 7. Size Shorthand
Instead of using both `w-24 h-24`, you can use the more concise `size-24` utility class. This shorthand reduces code duplication and improves readability when setting equal width and height values.

## 8. Divide Utilities
Use `divide-y-8` to create consistent spacing with dividers between elements instead of adding individual margins. You can also add colors with `divide-orange-500`. This approach is cleaner than manually adding borders to each element.

## 9. Space Utilities
When `flex` isn't applied, you can use `space-y-8` to create vertical spacing between children elements. This is particularly useful for stacking content with consistent spacing without wrapping each item.

## 10. Line Clamp
Use `line-clamp-3` to limit text to a specific number of lines with an ellipsis. This is perfect for card layouts, previews, or any content that needs to maintain consistent height regardless of text length.

## 11. Truncate
`truncate` is equivalent to `line-clamp-1` and simpler than using `text-ellipsis`. It's ideal for single-line text that needs to fit within a container while showing an ellipsis for overflow.

## 12. Button Focus Styling
Use `focus:outline-none` to remove the default browser outline on buttons, then add custom focus states like `focus:bg-blue-600`. This provides better control over accessibility and visual feedback.

## 13. Ring Utilities
Use `ring-1 ring-offset-2` for custom focus indicators that aren't borders or outlines. Rings are perfect for focus states as they don't affect layout and provide clear visual feedback. You can customize colors with `ring-blue-500`.

## 14. Gradient Backgrounds
Create beautiful gradients with `bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500`. You can also use `via` for three-color gradients and percentage stops like `from-blue-500 from-10% via-pink-500 via-50% to-purple-500 to-90%`.

## 15. Screen Reader Accessibility
- Use `sr-only` to hide content visually but keep it accessible to screen readers
- Use `not-sr-only` to make screen-reader-only content visible again on focus
- Essential for icons, buttons, and navigation elements that need descriptive text for accessibility

## 16. Tailwind Typography Plugin
The @tailwindcss/typography plugin provides a set of `prose` classes that make any HTML look nicely formatted. Perfect for markdown content, blog posts, and documentation.

**Installation:**
```bash
npm install -D @tailwindcss/typography
```

**Configuration:**
```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    // ...
  },
  plugins: [
    require('@tailwindcss/typography'),
    // ...
  ],
}
```

## 17. MDX Integration with Tailwind Prose Classes
Combining MDX with Tailwind's `prose` classes creates beautifully styled markdown content with zero configuration. The prose classes automatically style all markdown elements with consistent typography, spacing, and colors.

**Key Tailwind Focus:**
- **prose classes**: Automatic styling for markdown elements
- **prose-{size}**: Control typography scale (`prose-sm`, `prose-lg`, `prose-xl`)
- **dark:prose-invert**: Dark mode support for prose content
- **prose-{element}**: Fine-tune specific elements (`prose-headings:text-blue-600`)

**Core Prose Classes:**
```css
prose                    /* Base prose styling */
prose-sm prose-lg        /* Size variants */
dark:prose-invert        /* Dark mode inversion */
max-w-none             /* Remove max-width constraint */
prose-headings:text-blue-600  /* Style all headings */
prose-p:text-gray-700   /* Style paragraphs */
prose-a:text-blue-500   /* Style links */
```

**Automatic Element Styling with Prose:**
- **Headings**: Consistent sizing and spacing
- **Paragraphs**: Optimal line height and spacing
- **Lists**: Proper indentation and bullet styling
- **Tables**: Clean borders and cell padding (with remarkGfm)
- **Code blocks**: Syntax highlighting preparation
- **Blockquotes**: Distinctive styling with left border
- **Links**: Hover states and color styling

**MDX Component Integration:**
```tsx
export function useMDXComponents(components: MDXComponents): MDXComponents {
  return {
    // Wrap all content in prose classes
    wrapper: ({ children }) => (
      <div className="prose dark:prose-invert max-w-none">
        {children}
      </div>
    ),
    // Override specific elements while keeping prose benefits
    h1: ({ children }) => <h1 className="prose-h1 text-4xl">{children}</h1>,
    table: ({ children }) => <table className="prose-table">{children}</table>,
    ...components,
  };
}
```

**Advanced Prose Customization:**
```css
/* Custom prose modifiers */
prose-headings:font-bold prose-headings:text-slate-900
prose-lead:text-slate-700 prose-lead:text-xl
prose-a:font-semibold prose-a:no-underline hover:prose-a:underline
prose-strong:text-slate-900 prose-strong:font-semibold
prose-code:text-slate-900 prose-code:font-medium
```

**Benefits of Prose + MDX:**
- Zero configuration beautiful typography
- Responsive design built-in
- Dark mode support with `dark:prose-invert`
- Consistent spacing and rhythm
- Perfect for blogs, documentation, and content sites

**Next.js Setup** (minimal for Tailwind focus):
```bash
npm install @next/mdx remark-gfm
```

**Configuration:**
```js
// next.config.mjs - enables remarkGfm for tables
import createMDX from '@next/mdx';
import remarkGfm from 'remark-gfm';

const withMDX = createMDX({
  options: { remarkPlugins: [remarkGfm] }
});
```

The magic happens when prose classes meet MDX content - your markdown is instantly transformed into beautifully typeset content that looks professional and readable across all devices.
